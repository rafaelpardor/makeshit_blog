I'm Rafael Pardo, and I will use this blog to write about things I
learn, and do research about. There will be public notes, of how I
complete CTF's games, and probably more.

I wanted to create this blog in a manner of invest my time into write
about things I'm curious at, mainly focused on Computer Science topics,
maybe in the future, perhaps, even write about tough topics in a way
that could be accessible for everyone.

And altough I have almost 6 years of experience in the Software
Development realm, *(at the time I'm writing this)*, I believe that I'm
illiterateness in some topics and lack of some fundamentals. 

This blog will be a way to try to improve my knowledge.
