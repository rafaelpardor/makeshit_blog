# I'm tired

I said I was going to start writing a blog 4 or 5 years ago. Up until this day I've done nothing.

I'm tired of saying that I know stuff without doing stuff.

I'm tired of saying that I know how to do things without proof.

Altough I've written for myself I've never made public anything. I want to change that.
It's a small step, but my audience will be anyone who finds this. For the moment I have
no intentions of making promotions of this.
