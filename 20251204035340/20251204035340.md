# Why do we learn?

Why do we learn what we learn? Just to say that we know stuff? Or to make it applicable on our life.

Big mouth small actions, big actions no mouth at all.... Actions speaks louder than the voice.
It seems dumb until you have experienced what are the consequences of always talking but not showing results. 

Then, I'm in the middle of both. I don't speak nor I don't do anything. The things that I learn I don't apply it. But then I just say that I like or do stuff...

This letter that I'm writing doesn't make any sense at all... and it's the current state of my mind. I've lost my north related to the things that I use to like to do. For hence it feels fragmented.
Through my life I've suffer multiple traumas and the only things that has help me is to isolate. What makes me mad is to compare myself with other adults and maybe realized that they didn't went through for the same pain that I did.

NOW.... that doesn't convert in a victim. For some part of the things that has happen to me it's been all my fault. The good and the bad.

Boo hoo... poor me, I compare myself with people who does better than me. I know I'm in better place than some people of the world. People who has suffer even more than me... I didn't took advantage of some of the opportunities that I had. I let them go.
